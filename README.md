# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis:

Instacart, a leading online grocery store, is conducting a data analysis project to optimize marketing strategies. By examining customer purchasing behaviors, sales patterns, and demographics, the goal is to create a targeted marketing strategy that effectively reaches different customer segments. Using Python, the project will uncover insights on brand loyalty, ordering habits, price sensitivity, and product preferences. Findings will guide Instacart in delivering personalized promotions and improving ad placements, ultimately boosting sales and enhancing customer engagement.
## Key Questions:

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.

● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. 
## Analysis Criteria:
● Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries
manager.

● Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os,
matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).
